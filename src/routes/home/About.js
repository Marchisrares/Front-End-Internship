                    We work alongside multiple pet rescue organizations by providing them with discounted services and medications to treat relinquished, abandoned and stray animals as they are awaiting adoption to new homes. We love getting involved with animal rescues, shelters, charity events, adoption fairs, and more to give back and help as many animals and animal caregivers as possible. Most of all, we enjoy building lasting partnerships.
